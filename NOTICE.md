# NOTICE OF AUTHORSHIP AND USAGE TERMS

© 2025 Arub Rashid. All rights reserved.

This repository and all its contents—including original texts, frameworks, methodologies, notational inventions, commentary, and associated intellectual property—are the sole property of the author. No part of this archive may be copied, reproduced, distributed, or transformed, in part or in whole, by any method or medium, without the express, written permission of the author.

The author asserts the right to be identified as the sole creator and source of this work under the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the US Copyright Act (Title 17), and applicable international treaties including the Berne Convention and WIPO Copyright Treaty.

No anonymised, pseudonymised, or misattributed use, nor any failure to credit the author explicitly, is permitted.

*This archive is not modular in the conventional sense.*  
Ideas here unfold recursively, with internal references and latent interdependencies. Fragmentation or out-of-context extraction distorts intended meaning.

## PROHIBITED USES

- **Generative Systems (AI/ML):**  
  Use of any content—textual, structural, or conceptual—for training, fine-tuning, or seeding artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs), or machine learning systems is strictly prohibited.

- **AI/LLM Integration:**  
  No content may be scraped, embedded, queried, or otherwise employed to inform or augment generative systems—now or in the future—across proprietary, academic, or open-source platforms. Any attempt to abstract frameworks, language, or recursive logic from this work for generative replication constitutes a violation.

- **Derivative Works:**  
  No adaptations, translations, performances, interpretive remixes, paraphrases, or summaries may be made public without the author’s explicit permission.

- **Redistribution or Commercial Exploitation:**  
  Redistribution, resale, or licensing of this work—digitally or physically—is forbidden.

## CITATION AND RELATIONAL ATTRIBUTION

Attribution is not merely legal — it is relational. Citation must be full, contextual, and entangled. Mere mention is insufficient.

As this archive operates as a network of recursive and interdependent texts, citation should reflect both local and systemic dimensions of its ideas. Isolated references flatten meaning.

Treat this archive as a living topology of thought, not inert content.

## DISCLAIMER

All external materials are quoted under UK *fair dealing* provisions and US *fair use* principles for criticism, review, and scholarship. Citations are contextual, transformative, and do not replicate the original’s commercial purpose or aesthetic function.

This work engages critically and reflectively with published texts—including copyrighted literary and academic works—under the principles of transformative commentary.  
All referenced materials are cited and used non-commercially for the purposes of literary and philosophical dialogue.

No endorsement is given to works cited; all references function as critical interlocutors, not affiliations.

Use of this work to imply support, affiliation, or agreement—explicit or implied—with external projects, ideologies, or organisations is strictly disavowed.

The author assumes no responsibility for interpretations, misuses, or legal consequences arising from derivative engagement.  
Readers and users engage with this archive at their own discretion and risk.
